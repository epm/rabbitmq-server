=head1 NAME

rabbitmq-server - start RabbitMQ AMQP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rabbitmq-server [-detached]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RabbitMQ is an implementation of AMQP, the emerging standard for high
performance enterprise messaging. The RabbitMQ server is a robust and
scalable implementation of an AMQP broker.

Running rabbitmq-server in the foreground displays a banner message,
and reports on progress in the startup sequence, concluding with the
message "broker running", indicating that the RabbitMQ broker has been
started successfully. To shut down the server, just terminate the
process or use rabbitmqctl(1). 

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<MNESIA_BASE>
    Defaults to /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia. Set this to the directory 
    where Mnesia database files should be placed. 

B<LOG_BASE>
    Defaults to /var/log/rabbitmq. Log files generated by the server
    will be placed in this directory. 

B<NODENAME>
    Defaults to rabbit. This can be useful if you want to run more
    than one node per machine - B<NODENAME> should be unique per
    erlang-node-and-machine combination. See clustering on a single
    machine guide
    at http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#single-machine for
    details. 

B<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>
    Defaults to 0.0.0.0. This can be changed if you only want to bind
    to one network interface. 

B<NODE_PORT>
    Defaults to 5672. 

B<CLUSTER_CONFIG_FILE>
    Defaults to /etc/default/rabbitmq_cluster.config. If this file is
    present it is used by the server to auto-configure a RabbitMQ
    cluster.
    See the clustering guide at http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html
    for details.
