=head1 NAME

/etc/default/rabbitmq - default settings for RabbitMQ AMQP server

=head1 DESCRIPTION

/etc/default/rabbitmq contains variable settings that override the
defaults built in to the RabbitMQ startup scripts.

The file is interpreted by the system shell, and so should consist of
a sequence of shell environment variable definitions. Normal shell
syntax is permitted (since the file is sourced using the shell "."
operator), including line comments starting with "#".

In order of preference, the startup scripts get their values from the
environment, from /etc/default/rabbitmq, and finally from the built-in
default values. For example, for the B<RABBITMQ_NODENAME> setting,

B<RABBITMQ_NODENAME>
    from the environment is checked first. If it is absent or equal
    to the empty string, then 

B<NODENAME>
    from /etc/default/rabbitmq is checked next. If it is also absent
    or set equal to the empty string, then the default value from the
    startup script is used.

The variable names in /etc/default/rabbitmq are always equal to the
environment variable names, with the B<RABBITMQ_> prefix removed:
B<RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT> from the environment becomes B<NODE_PORT> in the
/etc/default/rabbitmq file, etc.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following is an example of a complete /etc/default/rabbitmq file
that overrides the default Erlang node name from "rabbit" to "hare":

    # I am a complete /etc/default/rabbitmq file.
    # Comment lines start with a hash character.
    # This is a /bin/sh script file - use ordinary envt var syntax
    NODENAME=hare
