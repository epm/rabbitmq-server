Template: rabbitmq-server/mnesia-dir-note
Type: note
Description: Schema changed
 The RabbitMQ database schema has changed. If your RabbitMQ database contains important data, such as user accounts, durable exchanges and queues, or persistent messages, then we recommend you contact support@rabbitmq.com for assistance with the upgrade. If you want to experiment with the new version in the meantime, simply move the database directory to a safe place. In all other cases just remove the directory.
